# Hugging Face Diffusion

**Hugging Face Diffusion** is a set of tools designed to assist in generating images using the **Stable Diffusion** model. This project simplifies the process for artists, developers, and researchers to produce high-quality images from text prompts or modify existing images. What sets this version apart is its hosting on **Google Colab** via **Hugging Face** integration, making it more accessible without needing complex local setups.
